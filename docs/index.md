# Module 7 Assignment
## Script Background
In this assignment, I created a script that allows the user to enter in the day's temperature and dew point temperature in Fahrenheit. This data can be easily looked up on any typical weather website. The script uses this information to output the saturated vapor pressure, actual vapor pressure and relative humidty. 

*What do these values mean?*

*Actual Vapor Pressure-->Actual vapor pressure is a measurement of the amount of water vapor in a volume of air and increases as the amount of water vapor increases. Air that attains its saturation vapor pressure has established an equilibrium with a flat surface of water. That means, an equal number of water molecules are evaporating from the surface of the water into the air as are condensing from the air back into the water.*

*saturated vapor pressure-->as many molecules returning to the liquid as there are escaping. At this point the vapor is said to be saturated, and the pressure of that vapor (usually expressed in mmHg) is called the saturated vapor pressure.*

*Relative humidity-->the ratio of the actual to the saturation vapor pressure.*

*Why does Relative Humidity matter?*

*Meteorologists often use the relative humidity as a measurement to describe the weather at various places. It is a way of describing how much humidity is present in the air, compared to how much there could be. It also is a key component in climate control settings. Whether you’re storing goods or maintaining a buldings or vehicle's climate, maintaining the correct relative humidity is the only way to ensure mold, mildew, condensation, and ice don’t interfere with your everyday business.*
