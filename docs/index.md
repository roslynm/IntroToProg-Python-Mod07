# Module 7 Assignment
## Background
In this assignment, I created a script that allows the user to enter in the day's temperature and dew point temperature in Fahrenheit. This data can be easily looked up on any typical weather website. The script uses this information to output the saturated vapor pressure, actual vapor pressure and relative humidty. 
What do these values mean?
Actual Vapor Pressure=Actual vapor pressure is a measurement of the amount of water vapor in a volume of air and increases as the amount of water vapor increases. Air that attains its saturation vapor pressure has established an equilibrium with a flat surface of water. That means, an equal number of water molecules are evaporating from the surface of the water into the air as are condensing from the air back into the water.
